HematoVision : 
Advanced Blood Cell Classification Using Transfer Learning
 
 Project Overview :
 HematoVision is a deep learning-based project designed to accurately classify different types of
 blood cells using transfer learning techniques. The aim is to support hematologists and lab
 technicians in automating blood smear analysis for faster and more consistent diagnosis of various
 blood disorders.
 
 Objective :
 To develop a robust and accurate model that classifies blood cell images into categories such as:- Neutrophils- Lymphocytes- Monocytes- Eosinophils- Basophils
 Using transfer learning enhances performance by leveraging pre-trained Convolutional Neural
 Networks (CNNs) instead of training a model from scratch.
 
 Technologies Used-
 Python- TensorFlow / Keras- OpenCV (for preprocessing)- Transfer Learning Models: MobileNetV2, ResNet50, VGG16- Flask (for deployment)- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for
